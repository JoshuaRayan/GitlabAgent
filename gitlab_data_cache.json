    "content": "Engineering The GitLab Product team looks ahead for expanding the platform \u201cWhat\" (customer needs) and \u201cWhy\u201d (business strategy) and Engineering determines the \u201cHow\u201d (technical implementation) and \u201cWhen\u201d (scheduling) of the platform releases. The content on this page talks about how we do engineering at GitLab. Engineering Direction GitLab has a Three-Year Strategy, and we\u2019re excited to see every member of the Engineering division contribute to achieving it. Whether you\u2019re creating something new or improving something that already exists, we want you to feel empowered to bring your best ideas for influencing the product direction through improved scalability, usability, resilience, and system architectures. And when you feel like you need to expand your knowledge in a particular area, know that you\u2019re supported in having the resources to learn and improve your skills. Our focus is to make sure that GitLab is enterprise grade in all its abilities and to support the AI efforts required to successfully launch AI features to General Availability. Making sure that GitLab is enterprise grade involves several teams collaborating on improving our disaster recovery and support offerings through ongoing work with GitLab Dedicated and Cells infrastructure. Our goal here is improved availability and service recovery. Engineering Culture Engineering culture at GitLab encompasses the processes, workflows, principles and priorities that all stem from our GitLab Values. All these things continuously strengthen our engineering craftsmanship and allow engineers to achieve engineering excellence, while growing and having a significant, positive impact on the product, people, and the company as a whole. Our engineering culture is primarily being carried and evolves through knowledge sharing and collaboration. Everyone can be part of this process because at GitLab everyone can contribute. Engineering Excellence Engineering excellence can be defined as an intrinsic motivation to improve engineering efficiency, software quality, and deliver better results while building software products. Engineering excellence is being fueled by a strong engineering culture combined with a mission: to build better software that allows everyone to contribute. Engineering Initiatives Engineering is the primary advocate for the performance, availability, and security of the GitLab project. Product Management prioritizes 60% of engineering time, so everyone in the engineering function should participate in the Product Management prioritization process to ensure that our project stays ahead in these areas. Engineering prioritizes 40% of time on initiatives that improve the product, underlying platform, and foundational technologies we use. Work in the 40% time budget should be coordinated and prioritized by the Engineering Manager of a team. Use the label Engineering Time for issues and MRs that are done as part of it so we can follow the work and the results across the engineering division. Contributing to broad engineering initiatives and participating in working group-related tasks. Review fixes from our support team. These merge requests are tagged with the Support Team Contributions label. You can filter on open MRs. Working on high priority issues as a result of issue triaging. This is our commitment to the community and we need to include some capacity to review MRs or work on defects raised by the community. Improvements to the performance, stability and scalability of a feature or dependency including underlying infrastructure. Again, the Product team should be involved in the definition of these issues but Engineering may lead here by planning, prioritizing, and coordinating the recommended improvements. Improvements and upgrades to our toolchain in order to boost efficiency. Codebase improvements: Removing technical debt, updating or replacing outdated dependencies, and enhancing logging and monitoring capabilities. Constructing Proof-of-Concept models for thorough exploration of new technologies, enhancements and new possibilites. Work on improvements and feature enhancements to the product, in the sense of internal community contributions, that would increase our internal engineering productivity by focusing on ready-to-go items that are currently assigned a low priority in the backlog. Engineering Innovation Engineering Innovation is a new process geared toward individual or small-team collaboration that encourages engineers to explore new ideas and Proof-of-Concepts. These projects are typically lean, time-boxed, iterative, and designed to validate whether an idea has the potential to evolve into a viable experimental feature or product. See the Innovation at GitLab Guide. Technical Roadmaps Some of the above examples for the 40% time budget can help in forming a long-term technical roadmap for your group, and determine how best to prioritize your technical work to support overall business goals.

    "content": "Product Handbook Most of the content in the product handbook talks about how we do product at GitLab. Welcome to the Product Team Handbook The Product Team is led by David DeSanto. The Product Handbook focuses on how we do product at GitLab. Please see Product Direction to learn about what the Product Team plans to build. Product Team Functions Product Management User Experience Product Technical Program Management Product Team Mission We create products and experiences that customers love and value. Consistency wins as you scale. Our organizational goal is to create a Product Manager (PM) system that maximizes the chances of success across new products, new features, and new team members. We are shipping an experience, and not just a product. Don\u2019t forget about the links between the product and the website, pricing & packaging, documentation, sales, support, etc. It\u2019s about our customers and doing a job for them, not the product itself. Think externally about customer problems, not internally about the technology. It\u2019s about love AND value. Will customers value what we are building? We need to make sure what we build helps build and extract customer value. Contributing to the Product Handbook The product handbook is widely referenced by product managers and cross-functional team members. Therefore, we want to follow a consistent change management process so all affected collaborators are aligned and informed when there are changes (specially new requirements, processes, meetings, etc.) that affect their workflow. It is helpful to indicate which type of change you are suggesting: Small improvement (typos, clarifications, etc.) Adding a new section Modifying existing section Documenting a new process Adding a new page or directory Other For a small improvement, please feel free to merge the MR yourself. Otherwise, please tag the appropriate code owner for review and approval. The guidance below should be followed for driving awareness: Informing team members about the changes It is your responsibility to communicate with relevant team members about your merge request. Here are some best practices to follow: For significant changes affecting the whole Product or Engineering team, consult your manager or product leader for the best communication strategy. For changes specific to product management, tag @gl-product-pm in the merge request before merging. Indicate in the comment whether you are requesting contributions and feedback or simply providing information. For changes relevant to other teams, tag department leads such as the VP of UX, VP of Development, or the Director of Quality Engineering in the merge request before merging. Share and cross-post the merge request link with a brief description in relevant channels such as Slack #product, #product-leadership, #eng-managers, and #ux-managers.

Marketing Alignment As the GitLab Marketing team puts customers at the center of everything we do, the marketing strategy aligns with the customer journey. The journey\u2019s purpose is to provide a clear and cohesive experience to a prospect/customer from the minute they become Aware of GitLab, to Considering the platform and Converting into a happy customer, and then of course Expanding over time and becoming an Evangelist. Each stage has a purpose which is the guiding indicator for the marketing team to measure our success. Everything the team plans and executes in the short and long term will revolve around the customer journey, and we will also measure our success along each step to hold ourselves accountable. Marketing Strategy Our FY25 Marketing Strategy and Plan can be found in the internal handbook. Marketing OKRs Each quarter, the Marketing team creates OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) that cascade from the CEO\u2019s OKRs. Each department within the Marketing team manages their own cascading OKRs. Team members can access the filtered OKR search. How we work Value-driven Marketing Team How we work as one team aligns with the GitLab Values. Results - The team measures success together along the customer journey. Each quarter, we align CMO OKRs based on company goals set in the company OKRs. This helps us stay aligned with company-level goals while also understanding if what we are doing quarter over quarter is moving the needle on our marquee metrics along the customer journey. Being data-driven as a team is essential for team success. Iteration - Like the rest of the company, we aspire to be agile and experimental where possible. In every area possible, we roll out campaigns, brand updates, messaging, etc. in small iterations, measure the success, and take next steps accordingly. Transparency - We strive to be as transparent as possible in all areas of marketing. We welcome thoughts and feedback from each other, other GitLab team members, and the community at all times. Collaboration - A major key to success is operating as one team. Leveraging the different backgrounds, cultures and, skill sets of an entire company and community, the marketing team operates in a way where everyone can contribute. Collaboration is key to taking Marketing to the next level. Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging (DIB) - With GitLab team members being located across the world, we strive to always keep DIB at the core of everything we do. Like the rest of GitLab, we follow asynchronous meeting principles, welcome diverse perspectives, and as marketers, foster an environment where quirkiness is welcomed. Efficiency - We keep efficiency at the forefront of everything we do.

    "title": "Security at GitLab | The GitLab Handbook",
    "content": "Security at GitLab Security Vision and Mission Our vision is to transparently lead the world to secure outcomes. Our mission is to enable everyone to innovate and succeed on a safe, secure, and trusted DevSecOps platform. This will be achieved through 5 security operating principles: Accelerate business success with a focus on: Prioritize \u2018boring\u2019, iterative solutions that minimize risk Find ways to say Yes Understand goals before recommending solutions Use GitLab first Efficient operations with a focus on: Technical controls over handbook rules Leverage automation first (robots over humans) Responsible decisions (Spending, Tooling, Staffing, etc) over low ROI (return on investment) decisions Reusable or repeatable over singular solutions Transparency with a focus on: Responsible protection of MNPI (material non-public information) Evangelize dogfooding of GitLab publicly Lead with metrics Balance security with usefulness Risk Reduction with a focus on: Secure by default Preventative controls over detective controls Solving root causes over treating symptoms Visibility through Coverage, Discoverability, Observability Collaborative Culture with a focus on: Working together on common solutions Solve shared problems with shared solutions Simplifying language for everyone to understand Avoiding security jargon Seek opportunities to help others succeed To help achieve the vision of transparently leading the world to secure outcomes, the Security Division has nominated a Security Culture Committee. Division Structure The Security Division provides essential security operational services, is directly engaged in the development and release processes, and offers consultative and advisory services to better enable the business to function while minimising risk. To reflect this, we have structured the Security Division around four key tenets, which drive the structure and the activities of our group. These are : Product Security Security Operations Corporate Security Security Assurance Application Security Infrastructure Security Security Platforms and Architecture Vulnerability Management Data Security Security Logging Security Incident Response Team (SIRT) Trust and Safety Red Team Threat Intelligence Signals Engineering Corporate Security Helpdesk Support Tech Stack Systems Engineering Teams Field Security Security Compliance Security Governance Security Risk Secure the Product - The Product Security Department The Product Security Department is primarily focused on Securing the Product. This reflects the Security Division\u2019s current efforts to be involved in the Application development and Release cycle for Security Releases, Infrastructure Security, and our HackerOne bug bounty program. The term \u201cProduct\u201d is interpreted broadly and includes the GitLab application itself and all other integrations and code that is developed internally to support the GitLab application for the multi-tenant SaaS. Our responsibility is to ensure all aspects of GitLab that are exposed to customers or that host customer data are held to the highest security standards, and to be proactive and responsive to ensure world-class security in anything GitLab offers. Protect the Company - The Security Operations Department Security Operations Department teams are primarily focused on protecting GitLab the business and GitLab\u2019s platform. This encompasses protecting company property as well as to prevent, detect and respond to risks and events targeting the business and our platform. This department includes the Security Incident Response Team (SIRT) and the Trust and Safety team. These functions have the responsibility of shoring up and maintaining the security posture of GitLab\u2019s platform to ensure enterprise-level security is in place to protect our new and existing customers. Lead with Data - The Threat Management Department Threat Management Department teams are cross-functional. They are responsible for collaborating across the Security Division to identify, communicate, and remediate threats or vulnerabilities that may impact GitLab, our Team Members or our users and the community at large. Assure the Customer - The Security Assurance Department The Security Assurance Department is comprised of the teams noted above. They target Customer Assurance projects among their responsibilities. This reflects the need for us to provide resources to our customers to assure them of the security and safety of GitLab as an application to use within their organisation and as a enterprise-level SaaS. This also involves providing appropriate support, services and resources to customers so that they trust GitLab as a Secure Company, as a Secure Product, and Secure SaaS Protect the Organization - Corporate Security GitLab is both a company and a product. The Corporate Security department focuses on implementing and protecting the information technology (IT) related systems that the company uses to conduct business internally, and provides the hardware, softw...",

GitLab has recently surpassed the $150M ARR milestone, with unusually high revenue growth and retention rates. GitLab is uniquely positioned in the market with a vision to offer a single application for the entire DevSecOps lifecycle. GitLab competes across numerous market segments and aims to deliver value in 80+ market categories. GitLab\u2019s product vision is uniquely ambitious, as we were the first DevSecOps player to take a single application approach. From idea to production, GitLab helps teams improve cycle time from weeks to minutes, reduce development process costs, and enable a faster time to market while increasing developer productivity. With software \u201ceating the world,\u201d this is widely viewed as a mission-critical value proposition for customers. We also have a number of tailwinds in the form of cloud adoption, Kubernetes adoption, and DevSecOps tool consolidation, which are helping fuel our rapid growth. Finally, GitLab has an open source community and distribution model, which has exposed the value of GitLab to millions of developers and has sped up the maturation of our product through more than 200 monthly improvements to the GitLab codebase from our users. Strategic challenges Tension between Breadth and Depth: Our ambitious single-application product vision means we need to build out feature function value across a very large surface area. With so much to deliver in a single application, it is a big UX challenge to keep the experience simple, consistent, and seamless between DevSecOps phases. Our challenge is to drive the right balance between breadth and depth by retaining a seed then nurture approach in new product areas while simultaneously improving existing product areas that generate usage and revenue. Shifting more focus to product depth will allow us to win and retain sophisticated enterprise customers. GitLab.com and Self-Managed: Another challenge we face is the balance between our self-managed and GitLab.com offerings. GitLab's early paying customers were more interested in self-managed, and the majority of our customers use this offering today. As a result, we focused heavily on delivering a great self-managed customer experience. However, as the market shifts toward cloud adoption, we are seeing an increasing demand for our GitLab.com offering. We now need to rapidly meet the same enterprise-grade security, reliability, and performance expectations our paying customers have come to expect from self-managed in our SaaS (.com offering). Wide Customer Profile: We also serve a wide range of customers, from individual contributor developers to large enterprises, across all vertical markets. This range of deployment options and customer sizes makes our business complex and makes it hard to optimize the customer experience for all customer sizes. Over the past few years, we have prioritized enabling our direct sales channel, but in the process have not focused enough on great customer experiences around self-service purchase workflows, onboarding, and cross-stage adoption. Competition: Finally, we have formidable competition from much larger companies, including Microsoft, Atlassian, and Synopsys to name a few. Microsoft is starting to mimic our single application positioning, and while behind us in the journey, have substantial resources to dedicate to competing with GitLab.
